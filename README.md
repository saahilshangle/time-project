A user guide and architecture overview for my-app.

The codebase is divided between frontend and backend components. The backend is called `server` and uses the Express framework to create a REST API to interact with a HTTP server. I then execute instructions based on the URL called. From the frontend, called `client`, I use the React library and JSX JavaScript syntax extension to create the DOM and CSSOM for my-app. Within the frontend, I can make server calls by referencing the appropriate URL.

This web app is a blog platform that is a learning exercise for me in the areas of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, React, JSX, Express, Cors, MongoDB, NPM, Git, REST APIs, and more. The functional version will hopefully allow me to keep a continuous record of professional or personal updates in an easy to read format. Some next steps that I might consider is setting up distinct users and managing login information such that multiple people can make posts. This could be social media like or even a job pipeline depending on who ends up on this page.

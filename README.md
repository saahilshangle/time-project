A user guide and architecture overview for my-app.

The codebase is divided between frontend and backend components. The backend is called `server` and uses the Express framework to create a REST API to interact with a HTTP server. I then execute instructions based on the URL called. From the frontend, called `client`, I use the React library and JSX JavaScript syntax extension to create the DOM and CSSOM for my-app. Within the frontend, I can make server calls by referencing the appropriate URL.
